## About Me

I have a robust data analysis process that involves several key steps:

1. **Data Collection and Storage:** Utilizing SQL to efficiently store and manage data. This involves designing databases, creating tables, and optimizing queries for retrieval.

2. **Data Analysis:** Leveraging Python or R for exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and machine learning tasks. Python's libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib or R's tidyverse package are my go-to tools for these tasks.

3. **Visualization:** Presenting insights in an intuitive and visually appealing manner using Tableau or Power BI. These tools enable interactive dashboards and visualizations that facilitate understanding and decision-making.

## Data Analysis in Python

In this section, I showcase my [Python projects](https://github.com/rsaldana23/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/tree/main/Data%20Analysis%20in%20Python) for data analysis. From EDA to machine learning models, I demonstrate my proficiency in utilizing Python's data science libraries to extract insights from data.

## Data Analysis in SQL

Here, I delve into [SQL-based data analysis projects](https://github.com/rsaldana23/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/tree/main/Data%20Analysis%20in%20SQL). I highlight SQL queries for data retrieval, aggregation, and manipulation, showcasing my expertise in handling data directly from databases.

## Data Analysis with R

Explore my [R-based data analysis projects](https://github.com/rsaldana23/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/tree/main/Data%20Analysis%20with%20R) in this section. From statistical analysis to data visualization using ggplot2, I showcase how R is a powerful tool for exploring and analyzing data.

## Power BI Projects

In this section, I present my projects developed using [Power BI](https://github.com/rsaldana23/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/tree/main/Power%20BI%20Projects). These projects demonstrate my ability to create interactive dashboards and reports that provide actionable insights from data.

## Tableau Projects

Explore my [Tableau projects](https://github.com/rsaldana23/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/tree/main/Tableau%20Projects) here. I showcase visually appealing dashboards and visualizations created using Tableau, highlighting key insights derived from data analysis.

## Certificates

This section features [certificates](https://github.com/rsaldana23/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/tree/main/Certificates) and credentials relevant to my data analysis expertise. From online courses to specialized certifications, it demonstrates my commitment to continuous learning and skill development.
